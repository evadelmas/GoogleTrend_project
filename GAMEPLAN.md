# Gameplan for the GTrends project

## Main ecological question 
Are phenological mismatches contributing to the decline of north-american aerial insectivorous birds in a context of climate change?

## Conceptual framework
Insectivorous birds need to precisely time their spring arrival to nesting locations
in order to both maximize the duration of the reproduction season (i.e. arrive as early as possible)
and minimize the chances of starving (i.e. do not arrive before food (insects) is available).

Insects emerge each year at different dates depending on the local climatic conditions, but birds
have to decide their departure dates without knowledge of the conditions at destination.

If spring arrival dates of longer-distance are less variable (i.e. less synchronized with insects and more based on the daily duration),
these birds would be more vulnerable to climate change than short-distance migrants.

### Objectives
1. Show that GTrends are actually representative of true phenologic cycles (CCF)
  1. For every bird species used in the study
  2. For at least one species of butterfly (e.g. Monarch)
  3. Maybe another easy to identify genus? (e.g. Ladybird)
2. Build a list of birds to study 
  1. Select aerial insectivore species from northern temperate states (combining checklists from eBird and feeding strategies from De Graaf et al. 1985)
  2. Classify them as either Short-Distance or Long-distance migrants (using e.g. allaboutbirds.org side panel the life history tab)
2. Extract GTrends time series for these bird species
3. Extract GTrends time series for major insect groups (mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, butterflies, ants, etc.)
4. Compare the variability and synchronism of both bird groups with the insects' phenology
5. (might be a stretch) See if decline rates of each species correlate with the lack of synchronism
